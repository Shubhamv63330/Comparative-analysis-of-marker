The depiction of materials like text, photos, movies, 3D objects, etc. into our physical surroundings is known as augmented reality, or AR. Due to harsh landings, the majority of aircraft damage happens during the landing. In order to reduce the frequency of these circumstances, landing assistance technologies are being created. The robustness of two prominent fiducial markers ArUco and Fractal marker, under diverse environmental conditions include static and dynamic platforms, varying light intensity, occlusion, reflection, distortion, and detection through glass medium and many other situations considering the area of both markers identical. The suggested method makes use of a monocular camera and fractal markers as landing reference points. The height of the flight during the touchdown can be accurately determined by using the marker pose estimation algorithm.


In order to understand the difficulties that fractal markers have in comparison to ArUco markers for a clean landing of a quadcopter drone, a comparison between squared fiducial markers and fractal markers is made here. Detection rates for all conditions were calculated for each marker by analyzing the proportion of detected frames out of approximately 1800 total frames per condition. First, under occlusion, the traditional fiducial marker is not detected. The marking becomes undetectable if there is even a slight blockage in any area. Secondly, their size limits the range at which they may be identified. Large markers are detectable at a distance, but they become less visible as the camera gets closer, making it impossible to notice them. However, small markers are not detectable at great distances. The difficulties listed above have solutions suggested in this work. We introduce a new kind of marker called the Fractal marker, which is constructed by layering one squared marker on top of another along with the comparison of ArUco and Fractal marker in challenging conditions.
